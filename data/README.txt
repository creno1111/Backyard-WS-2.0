To upload the data files for the FS partition, follow these steps after uploading the WSv2 
firmware and ensuring that the ESP32 board is running WSv2. 

1) navigate to the board's IP address, which may require the use of an IP finder utility. 

2) ensure that the file upload setting is set to [FILE] upload, and then navigate to the 
data folder to select and upload the necessary files (All files). 

3) click on the [<-BACK] button to return to the WSv2 webpage.

Please note that during the initial bootup, you may need to restart the system if the 
Config AP fails to activate. The first bootup process will format the FS partition and
may not enter running mode.
